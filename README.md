->Introduction:
The Automatic Car License Number Plate Detection and Recognition system is an essential component of modern intelligent transportation systems. It provides a robust solution for accurately identifying and extracting license plate information from vehicle images or videos. In this proposal, we outline the use of the Inception model, a deep learning architecture known for its excellent performance in image recognition tasks, for license plate detection and recognition.

->Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a reliable and efficient system that can automatically detect and recognize license plates from car images or videos. The proposed solution will leverage the power of the Inception model to achieve high accuracy and robustness in license plate identification.


Proposed Solution:

Dataset Preparation:

Collect a diverse dataset of car images or videos with labeled license plate regions.
Annotate the license plate regions in the images or videos to create ground truth data.
Augment the dataset by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, and blurring to improve the model's generalization ability.
